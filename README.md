## Introduction

E-commerce has proven to be a big game-changer in the 21st-century economy. As one of the largest sales channels, second only to physical retail, e-commerce [is expected](https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/) to be responsible for 6.3 trillion USD in worldwide sales by the year 2024.

E-commerce is a highly competitive business, and building a positive user experience is crucial to retaining customers and improving conversions. It is not uncommon for companies to make a significant investment in optimizing the purchase flow on their e-commerce platforms.

One of the most significant components of this experience is **the shopping cart**.

In this lab, we will be building the **IronCart**, a shopping cart for the unofficial Ironhack merchandising store. Visitors should be able to add and remove products from the shopping cart and modify the number (quantity) of items that they want to purchase. Additionally, users should be able to see the subtotal and total price for the items they have added.

## Requirements

- Fork this repo.
- Clone it to your machine.

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Solved lab"
$ git push origin master
```

- Create a Pull Request so that your TAs can check your work.

## Instructions

You will do most of your work in the `src/index.js` file. We added the initial markup in `index.html` and some basic styling. While developing, make sure you use the same class names as those already used (and available in the CSS file) to make our shopping cart nice and clean.

Let's go!

<br>

### Iteration 1: `updateSubtotal`

Open the `index.html` in your browser. As you can see, there is only one row in the table that represents one product. In this first iteration, you will be focused just on that product, and later on, we will help you think of ways to upgrade to having multiple products.

Let's take a look at the provided HTML code. We have the **table tag with the id `#cart`**, as shown below:

```html
<table id="cart">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Product Name</th>
      <th>Unit Price</th>
      <th>Quantity</th>
      <th>Subtotal</th>
      <th>Action</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="product">
      <!-- ... -->
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <!-- ... -->
</table>
```

<br>

![](https://i.imgur.com/zCWQYg2.png)

<br>

The one product we currently have in our `#cart` is placed in the `tr` with the class `product` (**that goes inside of `tbody`**):

```html
<tr class="product">
  <td class="name">
    <span>Ironhack Rubber Duck</span>
  </td>
  <td class="price">$<span>25.00</span></td>
  <td class="quantity">
    <input type="number" value="0" min="0" placeholder="Quantity" />
  </td>
  <td class="subtotal">$<span>0</span></td>
  <td class="action">
    <button class="btn btn-remove">Remove</button>
  </td>
</tr>
```

The product has a **price** and **quantity** (where quantity represents how many items of a specific product a user has added to the cart). In the provided code, we see that there is also a **subtotal price**. The subtotal price will be the result of the _multiplication_ of those values.

Your goal is to calculate the subtotal price, but let's approach it gradually. Let's break it down into a couple of steps:

- **Step 0**: In this step, our goal is to help you understand the provided code in the `src/index.js`. Thanks to the provided code, the `Calculate Prices` button already has some functionality. Using the DOM manipulation, we got the element with the `id="calculate"` and added an event listener `click` to it. When clicked, this button will fire the `calculateAll()` function. The following code snippet does exactly what we explained:

```javascript
// src/index.js

window.addEventListener('load', () => {
  const calculatePricesBtn = document.getElementById('calculate');
  calculatePricesBtn.addEventListener('click', calculateAll);
});
```

Don't get confused with [.addEventListener()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_addeventlistener.asp) method, it does exactly the same as [onclick()](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ev_onclick.asp), with some differences about which you can find more [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6348494/addeventlistener-vs-onclick). In this lab, you can use whichever method you prefer.

Ok, let's move to the `calculateAll()` function. In this function, we used `querySelector` to get the first (and currently the only) DOM element with the class `product`. This element (which we saved in the variable named `singleProduct`) is passed as an argument to the `updateSubtotal()` function. As you can find in the comments, the provided code snippet is used only for testing purposes within iteration 1.

```js
function calculateAll() {
  // code in the following two lines is added just for testing purposes.
  // it runs when only iteration 1 is completed. at a later point, it can be removed.
  const singleProduct = document.querySelector('.product');
  updateSubtotal(singleProduct);
  // end of the test

  // ITERATION 2
  //...
  // ITERATION 3
  //...
}
```

And finally, we started the `updateSubtotal(product)` function. For now, the only thing this function is doing is alerting `Calculate Prices clicked!` when the _Calculate Prices_ button is clicked.

<br>

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_e50868b669d962f3ddb26802e5a16638.gif)

<br>

Let's start:

- **Step 1**: Inside `updateSubtotal()`, create two variables (we suggest naming them `price` and `quantity`) and use your just gained DOM manipulation skills to GET DOM elements that hold price and quantity. To give you a head start, you could use the following code to get the DOM element holding the `price`:

```js
// src/index.js
function updateSubtotal(product) {
  const price = product.querySelector('.price span');
  // ... your code goes here
}

```


- **Step 2**: Now, when you got the above-mentioned DOM elements, your next step should be extracting the specific values from them. _Hint_: maybe `innerHTML` rings a bell? In case you are curious to find other ways to achieve the same result, you can start by checking [`textContent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent) and [`innerText`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/innerText) on Google. Additionally, you can extract the value from an input by accessing an [the input element's `value` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#htmlattrdefvalue). However, don't get distracted here, let this be your _additional reading_ when you complete the lab.

- **Step 3**: Use the values you extracted from the above-mentioned DOM elements to calculate the subtotal price. You can create a new variable, and its value will be equal to the product of these values. Ex. If a user picked 3 Ironhack Rubber Ducks, they should see that the subtotal is 75 dollars ($25 \* 3 = $75).

- **Step 4**: Now, when you are becoming a DOM manipulation ninja, use your skills once again to get the DOM element that should hold the subtotal. _Hint_: it is the element with the class `subtotal`.

- **Step 5**: In step 3, you calculated the subtotal price, and in step 4, you got the DOM element that should have displayed this price. In this step, your goal is to set the subtotal price to the corresponding DOM element. Also, make sure this function returns the value of the subtotal so you can use it later when needed.

In this iteration, you have completed creating the function `updateSubtotal` that **calculates the subtotal** for this specific product, **updates the subtotal value** for that same product in the DOM and returns the **subtotal value**.

As a single argument, the function should take a **DOM node** that corresponds to a single `tr` element with a `product` class. In the boilerplate code included, we called it `product`.

```js
function updateSubtotal(product) {
  // ...
}
```

:bulb: _Hint_: Make sure your `calculateAll()` function has the testing code we previously mentioned. If the code is in its place after you successfully finished the `updateSubtotal()` function, you should be able to see the corresponding updates in the `Subtotal` field in the table.

Check [here](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_30b87c596b79954f63b3482d2f320fe4.gif) the expected output.

<hr>

### Iteration 2: `calculateAll()`

Our current code works perfectly for one product, but we expect to have more than one product in our cart. As such, we will use `calculateAll` to trigger the update of subtotals for every product.

Complete the function named `calculateAll()`. Its purpose is to call the function `updateSubtotal` with every `tr.product` DOM node in the `table#cart`.

To start, remove or comment out the existing code inside the `calculateAll()` (the code we used for testing purposes). Also, let's add a new product to our `index.html` file. Duplicate the `tr` with the class `product`, rename the product inside, and change the product price.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Pv4NmR8.png)

:bulb: _Hint_: Start with getting the DOM nodes for each product row. Currently, we have two products; thus, we have two rows with the class `product`. Maybe using [getElementsByClassName](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementsByClassName) could serve well here.

```js
function calculateAll() {
  // ...
}
```

The final output should look like the following:

<br>

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_0efb56fc0e5717469417e806fa7cde12.gif)

<hr>

### Iteration 3: Total

Our calculation functionality is still incomplete. The subtotal for each product is being updated, but the total value remains untouched.

At the end of the `calculateAll()` function, reuse the total value you just calculated in the previous iteration and update the corresponding DOM element. Calculate the total price for the products in your cart by summing all of the subtotals returned by `updateSubtotal()` when it was called with each product.

Lastly, display that value on your DOM.

<br>

<hr>

## Bonus Iterations

### Iteration 4: Removing a product

Users should be able to remove products from their carts. For that purpose, every product row in our table has a "Remove" button at the end.

But let's try to solve our problem one bit at a time. Inside of the existing function you're passing to `window.addEventListener()`, start with querying the document for all "Remove" buttons, loop through them, and add a `click` event listener to each, passing a named function `removeProduct` as the callback argument. If you need a hint on how to do this, just take a look at how we did it by adding an event listener on the `calculatePricesBtn`.

We already declared `removeProduct(event)` and added some starter code. After you are done with querying the remove buttons and adding the `click` event listener on them, open the console and click on any `Remove` button.

As we can see, `removeProduct(event)` expects the event as a single argument, and that is going to trigger the removal of the corresponding product from the cart.

:bulb: Tip: To access the element an event was fired on, you can reference `event.currentTarget`. To remove a node from the DOM, you need to access its parent node and call [`removeChild`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/removeChild) on it. You can access the parent of a DOM node from its property `parentNode`.

Make sure the price gets updated accordingly when you remove products from the shopping cart.

<hr>

### Iteration 5: Creating new products

To finish it off, we will allow the user to add a custom product to their cart.

Uncomment the `tfoot` element and its children from the `index.html` file:

```html
<table>
  <tbody>
    <!-- ... -->
  </tbody>
  <!-- <tfoot>
    <tr class="create-product">
      <td>
        <input type="text" placeholder="Product Name" />
      </td>
      <td>
        <input type="number" min="0" value="0" placeholder="Product Price" />
      </td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td>
        <button id="create" class="btn">Create Product</button>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot> -->
</table>
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/J8aserm.png)

The two inputs inside of `tfoot` represent the name of the new product and the unit price, respectively. The "Create Product" button should add a new product to the cart when triggered.

Add a `click` event handler to the "Create Product" that will take a function named `createProduct` as a callback.

In `createProduct` you should target the name and unit price input DOM nodes, extract their values, add a new row to the table with the product name and unitary price, as well as the quantity input and "Remove" button, and ensure that all of the functionality works as expected.

Remember, the new product should look undistinguished and behave like any of the products previously included in the cart. As such, one should be able to calculate its subtotal when the "Calculate All" button is clicked, and remove the product.

When the product creation is finalized, please, clear the input fields in the creation form.

  <summary>I am stuck in the exercise and don't know how to solve the problem or where to start.</summary>
  <br>


  If you are stuck in your code and don't know how to solve the problem or where to start, you should take a step back and try to form a clear question about the specific issue you are facing. This will help you narrow down the problem and come up with potential solutions.


  For example, is it a concept that you don't understand, or are you receiving an error message that you don't know how to fix? It is usually helpful to try to state the problem as clearly as possible, including any error messages you are receiving. This can help you communicate the issue to others and potentially get help from classmates or online resources. 

  Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, you will be able to start working toward the solution.

  <summary>How do I loop over an array using the <code>forEach()</code> method?</summary>
  <br>


  The `forEach()` method executes a provided function once for each array element. It does not return a new array, but rather executes the function on each element in the array.

  The syntax of the `forEach()` method is as follows:

  ```js
  array.forEach( function(element) {
    // code to be executed for each element
  });
  ```

  Here is an example that uses the `forEach()` method to log each element and its index in an array to the console:

  ```js
  const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];

  fruits.forEach( function(element, index) {
    console.log(`${index}: ${element}`);
  });
  ```

  You can also use an arrow function as the callback function for `forEach()`:

  ```js
  fruits.forEach((element, index) => {
    console.log(`${index}: ${element}`);
  });
  ```

  <summary>How can I append a new DOM element to an existing one?</summary>
  <br>

  To append a new DOM element to an existing one in JavaScript, you can use the `appendChild()` method. 

  **Example:**

  ```js
  // Get the parent element
  var parentElement = document.getElementById("parent");

  // Create the new element
  var newElement = document.createElement("p");

  // Set the text content of the new element
  newElement.textContent = "This is a new paragraph.";

  // Append the new element to the parent element
  parentElement.appendChild(newElement);
  ```

  This will create a new `p` element with the text `"This is a new paragraph."` and append it to the element with the ID `parent`.

  <summary>Why do some DOM element values have to be converted to numbers when they already seem to be numbers?</summary>
  <br>

  This is because all values in HTML are strings and all attribute values are strings. Therefore, DOM element values are returned as strings even if they contain numeric values.

  If you want to use a value from a DOM element as a number, you will need to convert it to a number type.

  Here is an example of how to access and convert the value of the `price` element to a number using JavaScript:

  ```js
  // Get the input element
  const input = item.querySelector('input');

  // Convert the string value of the input element to a number
  const value = Number(input.value);
  ```

  <summary>I keep getting the <code>NaN</code> result in my program. How can I fix it?</summary>
  <br>

  In JavaScript, `NaN` stands for "Not a Number," and it is a special value that represents a problem with a numerical operation or a failed type of coercion. There are several reasons why you might get `NaN` as a result in your JavaScript code:



  1. **Dividing a number by `0`**: Any operation that involves dividing a number by `0` (zero) will result in `NaN`. Example:

   ```js
   const result = 10 / 0;
   
   console.log(result); // NaN
   ```

   <br>

  2. **Parsing an invalid number**: If you try to parse `undefined` or a string that can't be represented as a number using the `parseInt()` and `parseFloat()` functions, you will get `NaN` as a result. 
   <br>

   Example of parsing an invalid value with `parseInt()`: 

   ```js
   const result1 = parseInt("ironhack");
   const result2 = parseInt(undefined);
   
   console.log(result1); // NaN
   console.log(result2); // NaN
   ```

   <br>Example of parsing an invalid value with `parseFloat()`:

   ```js
   const result1 = parseFloat("ironhack");
   const result2 = parseFloat(undefined);
   
   console.log(result1); // NaN
   console.log(result2); // NaN
   ```

   <br>Example of parsing an invalid value with `Number()`:

   ```js
   const result1 = Number("ironhack");
   const result2 = Number(undefined);
   
   console.log(result1); // NaN
   console.log(result2); // NaN
   ```

   <br>

   

  To fix the `NaN` issue in your code, you can try a couple of things:

  - Check if you are attempting to divide a number by `0`. 
  - Make sure that the strings you are trying to parse as numbers are actually valid representations of numbers. You can use the `console.log()` to check the values of your variables and see if this is the issue.

  <summary>How do I add an event listener?</summary>
  <br>

  To add an event listener, use the `addEventListener()` method. This method takes two arguments: the *event type* and the *event handler function* that will be called when the event occurs.

  Here's an example of how to add a *click* event listener to a button element:

  ```js
  const button = document.querySelector('button');

  function handleClick() {
    console.log('Button was clicked');
  }

  button.addEventListener('click', handleClick);
  ```

  This will add a click event listener to the `button` element, which will call the `handleClick()` function whenever the button is clicked.

  <summary>How do I remove an event listener?</summary>
  <br>

  To remove an event listener, use the `removeEventListener()` method. This method takes two arguments: the *event type* and the *event handler function* that was originally assigned when adding the event listener.

  For example, let's say you have added the following event listener:

  ```js
  button.addEventListener('click', handleClick);
  ```

  To remove this event listener, you can use the following code:

  ```js
  button.removeEventListener('click', handleClick);
  ```

  <summary>Why am I getting <code>null</code> when I try to access an HTML element?</summary>
  <br>

  There are a couple of possible reasons why you might be getting a `null` value when trying to access a DOM element in JavaScript:

  1. **You are using the wrong selector or mistyping the name**: Make sure you are using the correct selector and spelling to access the element. If you are using an incorrect selector or mistyping the name, you will get a `null` value when you try to access the element.

  2. **The element is not yet loaded**: If you are trying to access an element that is not yet loaded in the DOM (e.g., an element that is defined in a script that is loaded at the bottom of the page), you will get a `null` value when you try to access it. You can fix this by wrapping your code in a `window.onload` event handler, which will ensure that the element is available before your code runs:

   ```js
   window.addEventListener("load", function (event) {
     const element = document.querySelector('#my-element');
     // now you can safely access the element
   };
   ```

  <summary>I am unable to push changes to the repository. What should I do?</summary>
  <br>


  There are a couple of possible reasons why you may be unable to *push* changes to a Git repository:

  1. **You have not committed your changes:** Before you can push your changes to the repository, you need to commit them using the `git commit` command. Make sure you have committed your changes and try pushing again. To do this, run the following terminal commands from the project folder:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push
   ```

  2. **You do not have permission to push to the repository:** If you have cloned the repository directly from the main Ironhack repository without making a *Fork* first, you do not have write access to the repository.
   To check which remote repository you have cloned, run the following terminal command from the project folder:

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

  If the link shown is the same as the main Ironhack repository, you will need to fork the repository to your GitHub account first, and then clone your fork to your local machine to be able to push the changes.

  Note: You may want to make a copy of the code you have locally, to avoid losing it in the process.
